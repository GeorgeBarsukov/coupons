# coupons  
This repository contains a script and images that the script looks for in order to clip all of the coupons on each website.  

To add another website, depending on how it works, add the coupon page for the website along with images of the 'clip' button and the 'next page' button (if applicable).

The '--open' flag to just open the website and make sure you're signed into all of them.  
The '--store' flag is used to specify a specific store for which to clip the coupons. The name must match the key in the website map.  

Use the key 'p' to cancel in case of errors.
